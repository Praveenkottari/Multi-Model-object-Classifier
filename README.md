# Genralized image classifcation pipline

This repository provides a complete end-to-end pipeline for multi-class image classification, designed to work with any number of classes and any image resolution. It integrates 12 state-of-the-art and fundamental backbone architectures, including both CNNs and Vision Transformers (ViTs), as well as two customized models tailored for multi-class classification problems.

The pipeline is highly versatile and simplifies the process of building, training, and evaluating classification models. It includes a comprehensive training module that automatically generates detailed summaries, performance metrics, and analysis reports for better insights into model performance.

Key Features:
* Support for Any Dataset: Easily adapt to datasets with varying class counts and resolutions.
* Diverse Architectures: Includes popular CNN backbones and ViT models for flexible experimentation.
* Custom Models: Two specialized models optimized for multi-class classification tasks.
* Comprehensive Training Module: Handles all stages of training, from preprocessing to generating performance reports.
* Insights and Analysis: Provides detailed summaries, metrics, and visualizations to aid in decision-making.

This repository is a valuable resource for researchers, students, and professionals working on image classification tasks, helping streamline workflows and improve outcomes.

## Model training

```bash
    cd ./path-to-/Multi-Model-object-Classifier
```

```bash
  python train.py --data_dir ./dataset #dataset directory with train & val
                  --model SimpleConvNet #resent18,vit....
                  --run_name run1_SimpleConvNet  #any name for result dir
                  --epoch 25 # number of epoch
                  ----num_classes=2 #by default 2
                  --batch_size=32 #change based on requirement       
```
note: run train-early_stop.py to consider the overfitting condition


## Running Tests
After training process complete  utilize the trained weights to test the model.
```bash
  python test.py --data_dir ./dataset --model deit --weights ./results/runs/run1_SimpleConvNet/weights/best.pt
```
